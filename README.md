====================

salient features of the browser DOM manipulated to demonstrate the futility of any kind of communication at all

## installation

add any file in the `dist` directory to a webpage. do it with a script tag:

```html
<script src="mgrn.js"></script>
```

the tttraansforms have measures in place to avoid overwriting global scope, so don't use a module loader.

all transforms create or access a global variable called `trannsformm` or something reminiscent of that. call installed modules on the `traaanssformm` object like this:

```js
ttrraaansfoooormm.mgrn(); // induce mgrn
```


### wat

if you're not a web developer, you can see these in action by just viewing the raw files in "dist", copying and pasting them into your javascript console, and then typing "t" into your JS console. on a modern browser it'll come up with an autocomplete menu, and you'll be able to tab-complete the transforms object. then you can run e.g `.lblb('div')` off it. (the javascript console is usually available at ctrl-shift-i).

## the transforms

more coming

### mgrn()
simulate the experience of a "hemicranial" migraine headache

usage:

```js
ttrraannnnsformm.mgrn(); // induce mgrn
```

### lblb(selector, replacement)
vowel removal and/or replacement

usage: 

```js
ttrrraaaaannsfforrrrrrmm.lblb('*');
// removes vowels inside all text in all elements

ttrrraaaannsfforrrrrrmmmmmm.lblb('li.navitem', String.fromCharCode(9731));
// removes vowels inside all text in all li elements with class 'navitem'
// and replaces them with unicode snowman
```

### lprn()
violate the sacred boundary between the internet and "real life" by printing a web page and bringing its content into the physical world

```js
trannssssforrmmm.lprn(); // reify nothingness
```
